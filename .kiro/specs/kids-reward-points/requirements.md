# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Kids Reward Points (KRP) system is a family-oriented web application designed to help parents track and manage reward points for their children. The system enables parents to create child accounts, award points for completed activities, and review activity requests submitted by children. Children can view their points balance, submit activity completion requests, and track their progress through a mobile-optimized Progressive Web App interface.
